			<p>Sofia Alexy S. Ubaldo is a 15-year old student who is currently a scholar of the Philippine Science High School – Central Luzon Campus. In October of 2020,
			she wrote a satirical essay entitled “Healthcare: A Right of The Masses” and passed it as her English project.
			</p>
			<p>After reading “A Modest Proposal”, a literary piece written by Jonathan Swift, she was inspired to create a satirical essay herself. Originally, she planned to make the essay about the prevalent issue of exploitation of children in the Philippines, but changed it to healthcare in the Philippines at the last minute. She chose healthcare in the Philippines as a topic because she thought that it was something that needed attention, and it is something that needs to be improved, especially since the country is in the middle of a pandemic. After providing multiple sarcastic solutions for her essay, she added 
			a serious and viable solution to show people what the country needs to do to improve healthcare.
			</p>
			<p>
			Some fun facts about Sofia Ubaldo is that she loves to sleep, her favorite show right now is Grey’s Anatomy, she loves to bake, and that she even coded this webpage herself.
			Moreover, she also loves to read books, travel to other countries, and cook for her family.
